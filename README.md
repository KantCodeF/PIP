Platformer Involving Physics is a game that me, Joris Ah-kane and Alex Ye created for your intergrative project.

In addition to being a regular platformer, we added representation of physics elements such as:

-A moon level with reduced gravity and lack of sound; 

-Springs that will estimate bounce based on the player "kinetic energy";

-Slippery block with reduced friction;

-slopped blocks with slipping physics.
