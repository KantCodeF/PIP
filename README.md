Puzzle Platformer Involving Physics is a game that me, Joris Ah-kane and Alex Ye created for your intergrative project.
In addition to being a regular platformer, we added representation of physics elements such as:A moon level with reduced gravity and lack of sound; 
springs that will estimate bounce based on the player "kinetic energy"; slippery block with reduced friction; slopped blocks with slipping physics.
